# Fragment Chain: Layer 2 Blockchain for Fractional Ownership

**Fragment Chain** is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain designed from the ground up to enable secure, scalable, and efficient tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs). With a focus on fractional ownership, compliance, and high throughput, Fragment Chain combines modern scalability techniques with decentralized infrastructure to redefine how RWAs are managed and traded.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Fractional Ownership**: Tokenize and manage fractionalized assets with metadata for provenance and compliance.
- **Scalability**: Leverages rollup technology to achieve low transaction fees and high throughput.
- **Custom Nodes**: Includes `frag-node` (Rust-based) for transaction validation and state management and `frag-batcher` (TypeScript-based) for efficient transaction batching.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly bridges assets between Layer 1 (Ethereum) and Layer 2.
- **Decentralized Metadata Storage**: Uses Arweave to store asset metadata for transparency and immutability.

## 📖 How It Works
1. **Layer 2 Infrastructure**:
   - `frag-node`: Validates transactions, manages state, and computes cryptographic proofs.
   - `frag-batcher`: Aggregates transactions and submits compressed batches to Layer 1.
2. **RWA Metadata**:
   - Metadata includes asset details, ownership, compliance, and more.
   - Stored permanently on Arweave for secure access and traceability.
3. **Bridging**:
   - Smart contracts enable deposits and withdrawals between Layer 1 and Layer 2.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core Components**:
  - Rust: High-performance node logic.
  - TypeScript: Flexible transaction batcher and integration services.
- **Smart Contracts**:
  - Solidity: Rollup and bridge contracts.
- **Storage**:
  - Arweave: Immutable and decentralized metadata storage.

## 🚀 Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Core development (node, batcher, and contracts).
- **Phase 2**: Testnet deployment and RWA tokenization demos.
- **Phase 3**: Mainnet launch with compliance and DEX integration.

Join us in creating the future of fractional ownership and tokenized assets. Together, we can unlock new possibilities for decentralized asset management!
